**4\. Conclusion**
==================

In this section, I will tell my final considerations about my journey.

First of all, more than a new badge and post on LinkedIn, you **will learn a lot during your studies**, especially with this roadmap.

This route of study will increase a lot your skills on AWS. The focus of this exam is **mainly on EC2, S3, and VPC**. You will see more products, but not so deep as them.

Finally, with this knowledge, you can apply for new **jobs and opportunities**. If you already have a job working with AWS, you can **bring innovation and new solutions.**
